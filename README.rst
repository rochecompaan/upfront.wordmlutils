Introduction

A set of utilities to transform to and from WordML.

An HTML to WordML transform is the only transform currently available.

It can be used both on the command line or called directly from your
Python application.

Command line usage
==================

usage: `html2wordml.py [-h] [-c] -p BASEPATH htmlfile`

Convert HTML to WordML

positional arguments
--------------------

htmlfile
    /path/to/htmlfile

optional arguments
------------------

-h, --help
    show this help message and exit

-c, --create-package
    Create WordML package

-p BASEPATH, --basepath BASEPATH
    Base path for relative urls

For example::

  ./html2wordml.py -c -p ./tests ./tests/test.html > test.docx


From Python
===========

::

    >>> from upfront.wordmlutils.html2wordml import transform
    >>> from StringIO import StringIO
    >>> html = """<html>
    <body>
    <p>Hello world!</p>
    </body>
    </html>"""
    >>> basepath = '/'
    >>> output = StringIO()
    >>> output = transform(basepath, html, outfile=output)
    >>> docxfile = output.getvalue()

The transform method above also takes an optional ``image_resolver``
argument. The ``image_resolver`` argument must be an instance of a class
that has a ``get_images`` method and returns a list of images where each
element in the list is the image data itself. Look at the default
``get_images`` method in ``html2wordml.py`` as reference.
